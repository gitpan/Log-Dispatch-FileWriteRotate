NAME
    Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate - Log to files that archive/rotate
    themselves, w/ File::Write::Rotate

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate;

     my $file = Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate(
         min_level => 'info',

         # will be passed to File::Write::Rotate
         dir       => '/var/log',
         prefix    => 'myapp',
         suffix    => '.log',
         period    => 'monthly',
         size      => 25*1024*1024,
         histories => 12,
     );

     $file->log(level => 'info', message => "Your comment\n");

DESCRIPTION
    This module functions similarly to Log::Dispatch::FileRotate, but uses
    File::Write::Rotate as backend, thus interoperates more easily with
    other modules which use File::Write::Rotate as backend, e.g.
    Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate or Process::Govern.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

METHODS
  new(%args)
    Constructor. This method takes a hash of parameters. The following
    options are valid: "min_level" and "max_level" (see Log::Dispatch
    documentation); "dir", "prefix", "suffix", "period", "size", and
    "histories" (see File::Write::Rotate).

  log_message(message => STR)
    Send a message to the appropriate output. Generally this shouldn't be
    called directly but should be called through the "log()" method (in
    LLog::Dispatch::Output>).
